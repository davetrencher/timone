TiMONe plugin for IntelliJ IDEA
==================================

    Introduction
        TiMONe is the plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.
        TiMONe is a monitoring tool to monitor http requests and responses.  It is useful when using xml or json services
        to view what is being sent and received between an application and the service that it is using.

        TiMONe is a TCP monitor plugin for Intellij.  It supports multiple tunnels running concurrently and will allow you to
        view the output of the request and response.


        It was originally fork of TunnelliJ which was created to do the same but support a single monitor running at once.
        TiMONe has significantly changed from this but you can find the original here: https://github.com/milanboruvka/tunnellij.
