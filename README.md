TiMONe
=========

TiMONe is a TCP MONitor plugin for Intellij.  It supports multiple tunnels running concurrently and will allow you to
view the output of the request and response.


It was originally fork of TunnelliJ which was created to do the same but support a single monitor running at once.
TiMONe has significantly changed from this but you can find the original here: https://github.com/milanboruvka/tunnellij.
